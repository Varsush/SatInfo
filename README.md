## 🧑‍💻 For Developers

To enable the optional ISS Tracking feature:

### 1. Run the Proxy Server (Local Setup)

This project includes a small proxy server (`proxy-server.js`) to securely fetch ISS data from the N2YO API. You must run it locally:

```bash
npm install express cors
node proxy-server.js
Keep the proxy server running while using the app.

The app sends ISS requests to: http://localhost:5000/iss-position.

💡 This step is only required if you wish to enable the ISS live location feature.
